Everyday on my way home I am stopped for some reason or another on Mission St just outside of McDonnalds and on top of the BART station. I joke with friends that some day I'll start a blog to list all of the different reasons why I've been stopped. What better post could be better, more well suited to start my blog with!

First, a little background into my neighborhood. It's an interesting place filled with every color of a person you could find. You have hipsters filled to the brim with ink. Wearing cloths that would make Macklemore himself jelly. Mission is also a heavily hispanic neighborhood with families who have lived in the area for possibly generations. Then you have the stereotypical San Francisco developers who have invaded every corner and crevice of all of the neighborhoods, like a virus. I like to think of myself as mono, personally. And of course the most interesting part comes from living in the gem of The Mission (16th and Mission) is the late night crack addicts. Free entertainment! All the time!

So, back to getting stopped all. the. time.

On my way home the roomy sidewalk is taken over with fruit stands from grocery shops that line Mission on one side and then impromtu 'used' and totally not 'hot' item shops laid out on blankets to entice people at a deal. This is all fun and cool. Except it takes up about 99.99999% of the sidewalk leaving only a little bit left for actual pedestrian traffic. This makes it an always interesting adventure.

Most of the time it's just some old person walking at 0.000001 MPH with a tennis ball clad walker. Other times is because of being approached by a totally legit guy trying to sell 'tickets' in a really quick, sketchy voice. 'ticket?' 'TICKET?'

:D
